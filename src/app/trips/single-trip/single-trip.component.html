    Theth is a small village in the Shkodra region of Albania. You could say
    that the place is somewhat isolated, which is exactly why the region is so
    beautiful! You get to see this part of nature relatively untouched.

          <strong>This is probably the most popular attraction in Theth,
            Albania.</strong>
          The blue eye is a water spring deep in the mountains of Albania. The
          water is incredibly blue, clear and cold! It looks extremely tempting
          to jump in and swim, but, think twice! It is so cold, you really don’t
          want to be in there. It’s about a 6 hour hike round-trip through
          mountains, rivers, cow fields and lots of trees. You do not want to
          miss this hike.

          This is a short one hour hike from Theth, and therefore a fun and easy

          There is not much to do in the small village of Theth, but that is one
          of the reasons you will enjoy your stay! You will find peace and
          tranquility here, a simply way of living. Visit the church in the
          village, which is beautifully surrounded by all the mountains. Then,
          eat at one of the restaurants and observe the stone houses where the
          local people live. Our favorite thing to do in Theth was to observe
          the farm animals graze the day away. Expect to see sheep, pigs, horses
          and much more!

          This is such an iconic hike! You hike from the village of Theth to the
          village of Valbona, which is about an 8 hour hike in total. You will
          feel like you’re on the moon or maybe Mount Everest. The rocks are
          white and grey, with the beautiful green trees at the bottom in the
          Valbona Pass.
